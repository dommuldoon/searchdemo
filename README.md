Please add your Twitter api key and secret to the .env file.

In the project directory, you can run:

'npm run dev'

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This runs the React app on port :3000 with a proxy node server on port :3001 to handle the Twitter OAuth.

I coundn't find a way to search Twitter for github repos so I just used the repo title as the search term.
